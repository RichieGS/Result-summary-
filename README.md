## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries


### What I learned

I learned about the "Media Query" while working on this project and i now have the basic knowledge of how to build a responsive website

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 967px) {
  /* Styles to be applied to a screen of min width of 375px and max width of 967px */
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.php) - This helped me to have a better understanding of how to use the media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
